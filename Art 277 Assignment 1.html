    <h1><b><u>Re: Albert Momo university application</u></b></h1>
    <p2>Dear Mr. Momo</p2><br>

<p style="margin-left: 3rem
;">
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University science faculty to study 
    as part of your PhD next year. <br> I will answer your questions one by one,  in the following sections.
</p>
<h3>
   <b> Sttarting dates</b>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit 
us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; <br> the start dates for each one are as 
follows:
<br><br>
First semester: 9 October 2022 <br>
Second semester: 15 January 2023 <br>
Third semester: 2 May 2023 <br> <br>
Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br><br>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
</p>
<h3>
    <b> Subjects of study</b>
 </h3>
 <p style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects 
fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.<br> You seem like an intelligent, dedicated 
researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, <br> of the ideas 
you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
<br><br><br><br>
Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)
Measuring the effect on performance of funk <br> bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), 
when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103
increasing to 3 × 104
.) <br><br>
HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
<br><br>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd 
expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, <br> and anything else you think we'd 
need to know? Thanks.
 </p>
 <h3>
    <b> Exotic dance moves</b>
 </h3>
 <p style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To 
answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
 </p><br>
 <p style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    Polynesian chicken dance
 </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 5rem;">
    A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village <br> 
would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
 </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    Icelandic brownian shuffle
 </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 5rem;">
    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting <br> warm, they used to practice 
    this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling <br> 
    their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. <br> One of my fellow 
    students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
    
 </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    Arctic robot dance
 </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 5rem;">
    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s 
    believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by <br> "robotic", stilted 
    movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on 
    however it was discovered <br> that they were just moving like this because they were really 
    cold. <br><br>
    For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.

    Yours Sincerely,
