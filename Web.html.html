Dear Mr. Momo,
<br/ > 

                        <br />

<p>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University’s science faculty to study<br>
as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
</p>


<h3>
    Starting dates
</h2>

                        
<p>
We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit<br>
us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as<br>
follows:

                        <br /> 
                        <br /> 
First semester: 9 October 2022<br> 
Second semester: 15 January 2023<br> 
Third semester: 2 May 2023
                        <br />


Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.

                        <br /> 

You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
</p>

<h3>
Subjects of study
</h3>


<p>
At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects<br> 
fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated<br> 
researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas<br>
you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority: 
</p>
Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefit of Reveratol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<br />
Measuring the effect on performace of funk bassplayer at temperature exceeding 30<sup>&#176;</sup> C(86<sup>&#176;</sup>F)<br />
when the audience size exponentially increase (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 30 x 10<sup>4</sup>)<br />

HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores<br />
<br />

So please can you provide more information each of these subjects, including how long you'd <br />
expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd<br />
need to know? Thanks <br />

<h3>
Exotic dance move
</h3>


Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dance. To <br />
answer your question, my favourite dances are as follow, with definition:<br />
<br />

Polynesian chicken dance
<p style="padding-left:58px ;">
A  little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village <br />
would dance around in a cricle like chicken, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
</p>

Icelandic brownian shuffle
<p style="padding-left:58px ;">
Before the Icelander developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice <br />
this dance, which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling<br />
their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow<br />
students usedto say that he thought the dance inspirred modern style such as Twerking. <br />
</p>

Arctic robot dance
<p style="padding-left:58px ;">
An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s<br />
believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted<br />
movements, being praticed by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on <br />
howeverit was discoveredthat they were just moving like this because they were really<br />
cold.
</p>

Yours sincerely,<br />
<br />
